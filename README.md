sudoku-tools
============

Python commandline tool designed to generate and solve sudokus, also can be used to validate existing sudokus.

It generates high quality sudokus very fast by exploiting the valid permutations an square of 9 tiles can have to generate a valid answer. It doesn't need any external python library and should work with the python version 2.6.x and later.
